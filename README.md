# Just-for-fun-webpage
This is a work in progress.

This is a page I made that was really just meant to practice new skills while learning at Udacity. The HTML does not look very good because I made it pretty early in when after I just finished the HTML/CSS course during phase 1 of the Front-End Web Developer course.

This page is based on a game called Mechwarrior by Microsoft. It was a favorite game of mine for many years and I thought it would be fun to make the page Mechwarrior themed.

The hover over images and audio clip were added later in just to practice CSS skills.

The cougar is really a light mech, not a medium...
