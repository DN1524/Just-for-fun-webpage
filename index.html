			<p class="set">It is the 31st century, and mankind is once again at war.</p> 
			<p class="set">The battlefields of the future are dominated by huge robotic war machines known as battlemechs.</p> 
			<p class="set">Piloting these awesome weapons of war are men and women, the elite of the elite, knowing that each battle could be their last.</p>
			<p class="set"> They are... Mechwarriors.</p>
			
			<h2>My Thoughts on Mechwarrior</h2>
			
			<p>I really do not know much about the story of the franchise... I just know that the game was pretty fun and played MW3 to MW4 mercs.
			When MWO came out, I gave it a try but did not really like too much. It reminded me too much about World of Tanks and also I did not want
			to pay $100 + on mechs I loved to play in the previous MW's...</p>
			
			<h2>My Favorite Mechs</h2>
			
			<h3>Annihilator  - Assault Mech</h3>
			<!-- <img src="http://m.blog.hu/ba/battletech/image/annihilator02.jpg" class="imgThree" alt="Annihilator"> -->
			<div class = imgThree> </div>
			<p class = comment>This was favorite Assault mech in MW3. It is a very slow mech, but can be heavily armed and deal major damage especially when
			armed with multiple ultra AC 20 cannons.
			
			<h3>Thor - Heavy Mech</h2>
			<!-- <img src="https://orig00.deviantart.net/bb7b/f/2010/138/1/2/thor_blueprint_by_walter_nest.jpg" class="imgTwo" alt="Thor/Summoner"> -->
			<div class = imgTwo> </div>
			<p class = comment>This was my first favorite mech. I When I first played this mech in MW3, I really liked how it looked and I loved to use PPC's
			and LBX cannons. When I started playing MW4, I changed to ER Heavy Lasers with LBX 10's. What I really liked about the Thor in MW4
			was it's good maneuverability and it's 360 degree torso twist.</p>
			
			<h3>Cougar - Medium Mech</h3>
			<!-- <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/474x/2b/c6/ac/2bc6acd4b269ef8a851ede57da870525--halo-warriors.jpg" class="imgFour" alt="Cougar"> -->
			<div class = imgFour> </div>
			<p class = comment>I started playing the cougar in MW4. I really like this mech because it is fast and a little harder to hit since it is short.
			I armed this mech like I would my Thor, with a couple of Large lasers and an LBX 10 cannon.</p>
			
			<h3>Osiris - Light Mech</h3>
			<!-- <img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CuPlzePoRGE/T1j-IL3X9OI/AAAAAAAAAJw/f0WgSbbTN8k/s1600/P1040644.jpg" class="imgFive" alt="Osiris"> -->
			<div class = imgFive> </div>
			<p class = comment>I don't normally play light mechs, but when I do, I prefer the Osiris.</p>
			<p class = comment>Anyway... I liked the Osiris better than the other light mechs in MW4 because I liked the way it looked was able to carry weapons
			bigger than machine guns.</p>
